## new: Reconfigure session and auth 

first: follow the steps from next auth docs for seting up auth and session+

1. Create auth: username and pw
2. save data in db

3. create a friends list on the / page.
(should be all users)

4. insert the game with the id of the clicked user in db
5. listen to the changes in the chessboard component with subscribe and update redux.

Done!
